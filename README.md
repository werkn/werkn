My names Ryan things I'm working on lately are:

- 🔫 N64 Homebrew Development Series on YouTube [](Playlist) / [](Repository)
- 😎 Building a Android Kotlin OpenGL ES Engine
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `C`, `Kotlin`, `Android` and `OpenGL ES` but typically work in `Java`
- 🤔 I’m looking to help with Android development on open-source projects looking for contributors
- 📫 How to reach me: I suppose a pull request on this README repo would do the trick
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
